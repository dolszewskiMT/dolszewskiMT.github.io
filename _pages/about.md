I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Florida, where I conduct research at the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity (FICS). My work focuses on advancing practical and theoretical approaches to modern security challenges.

I earned my B.A. in Mathematics, Computer Science, and Data Science from Carroll College, where I developed a strong interdisciplinary foundation and a passion for problem-solving. Beyond academics, I cultivated leadership and collaboration skills through extensive campus involvement, serving as Executive President of the Associated Students of Carroll College (ASCC) and sitting on key institutional committees, including Curriculum, Resources and Planning, Master Planning, and Policy. I was also honored to serve as the student representative on the Presidential Search Committee for the college’s 18th president.

As an Eagle Scout, I learned the importance of perseverance, teamwork, and service—principles that continue to guide my academic and professional pursuits. Whether in research, teaching, or leadership, I strive to approach every challenge with integrity, curiosity, and dedication.
